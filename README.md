Task 3-fetch-api
This is to fetch data from external sources (e.g., APIs) and display it dynamically on the webpage.

Here i used json

When the page loads, the JavaScript code sends a request to the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch a list of users. When the response is received, the code loops through each user object and creates a new li element with the user's name. The li elements are then inserted into the ul element, creating a list of users on the page.
