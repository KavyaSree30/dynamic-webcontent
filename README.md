#Dynamic content with javascript
This repository consists of three folders i.e.,each folder is a task.

task 1-Accordion folder consists of html,css,javascript files,
this is to implement interactive feature(accordion) using javascript.

task 2-form validation
it is used to validate the form using javascript

task 3-fetch-api
this is to fetch data from external sources (e.g., APIs) and display it dynamically on the webpage.
Here i used json
When the page loads, the JavaScript code sends a request to the JSONPlaceholder API to fetch a list of users. When the response is received, the code loops through each user object and creates a new li element with the user's name. The li elements are then inserted into the ul element, creating a list of users on the page.
